    <h1>Why create a password generator?</h1>
    <div class="main about">
      <p>
        The internet has become riddled with ads, popups and spyware. The top ranked sites on Google for "random password generator" are no exception. They are plagued by popups, cookie consent banners, and pitches to buy subscriptions to their software. Here are a few examples.
      </p>

      <h3>
        1. A noisy form trying to sell me a book. Includes spyware for fun.
      </h3>

      <img src="delinea.png" width="800"/>
      <img src="delinea_spyware.png" width="800" />

      <p>
        On first inspection this page is just noisy and annoying. But when I looked a little closer, it seemed that adblock had prevented several trackers from loading. At one point the page even tried to "call home" with who knows what information. A password generator that spies on you is a little like a fox guarding the hen house. We shouldn't have to put up with this.
      </p>

      <h3>
        2. A page with a popup.
      </h3>

      <img src="lastpass.png" width="800"/>

      <p>
        This time, if I click the "copy" button the page pops up an ad for LastPass. It also shows that the password was copied, but it's not that clear. It's deceptive design. Would my mom be more likely to notice the green banner, or the "Get LastPass Free" button? The web shouldn't be working against us like this.
      </p>

      <h3>
        3. "We value your privacy". Yeah, by selling it to the highest bidder?
      </h3>

      <img src="avast1.png" width="800" />

      <p>
        I have a hard time believing there are any cookies that could possibly improve my experience in generating a random password. And no, I'm not going to read your cookies policy just to accomplish this simple task.
      </p>

      <p>
        Valuing here probably means finding a fair market valuation by selling on the free market.

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Serve_Man_(The_Twilight_Zone)" target="_blank">"To Serve Man"</a>. Yum, cookies!

        It should surprise no one that "valuing" our privacy means the easiest option to click is to accept all cookies. Just let it happen. It's notable though, that this will share social media cookies. Social media cookies. What the hell.
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn't even get to the password generating part because I was too busy reading their cookies policy legalese.
      </p>

      <h3>
        4. Another site that requires cookies for some reason
      </h3>

      <img src="randomdotorg.png" width="800" />

      <p>
        Again with the cookie policies. No, I'm not going to read it because there's no good reason to need cookies. Random.org seems like a fairly reputable source so it's disappointing to see this.
      </p>

      <h3>
        5. Another popup. More cookies and slimy language.
      </h3>

      <img src="1password.png" width="800" />

      <p>
        Another popup to trick your mother into buying their product.
      </p>

      <img src="1password_cookies.png" width="800" />

      <p>
        More cookies. Just why. You should ask yourself if the experience is being improved, who is it being improved for?
