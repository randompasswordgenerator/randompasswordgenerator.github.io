# Why create a password generator?
It's not because creating a random password is a particularly hard thing to do. Sampling from a set of characters with replacement, given sufficient length, should provide enough entropy to keep most hackers busy. For extra safety, use the native crypto API.

But that's not the point. The internet has become riddled with ads, popups and spyware. The top ranked sites on Google for "random password generator" are no exception. They are plagued by popups, cookie consent banners, and pitches to buy subscriptions to their software. I shouldn't need to read a cookie policy just to accomplish this simple task. This tool aims to be an alternative.
